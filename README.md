# Fallout 76 Launch Code Cracker
Simple program for cracking the launch codes to Fallout 76's nuclear silos.

## F.A.Q.

### What does it do?
Takes in the keyword or partial keyword, the silo codes (you need all 8), and then gives a potential 
launch code. More letters in the keyword means a greater chance of success, but this program will brute
force codes for a keyword even with one letter.

### Why is it so ugly?
I'm a programmer, not a UI/UX designer.

### Why a Java/Desktop app and not a webapp
Simple, no hosting fees and none of that telemetry/tracking bullshit. There's nothing in this app to 
steal data or track what you're doing.

### Releases
For those of you that just want to run, there's a Runnable JAR and a JAR wrapped in an EXE with JRE 
included on the releases page.  
For everyone else, download the source here and compile.

### It's broken / Didn't do anything / Got an error
It's not perfect, and I whipped it up in a few hours, so expect issues and other spectacular things.
If it did one of these things, report an issue using the template below.
